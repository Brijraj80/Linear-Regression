# Linear-Regression
Linear regression strives to show the relationship between two variables by applying a linear equation to observed data. One variable is supposed to be an independent variable, and the other is to be a dependent variable. For example, the weight of the person is linearly related to his height. Hence this shows a linear relationship between the height and weight of the person. As the height is increased, the weight of the person also gets increased.
